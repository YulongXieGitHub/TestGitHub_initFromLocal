Learning github from the Youtube Tutorial: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c"

----------------------------- exercise two: (1) create local folder, (2) initilize it as a repository (3) push back to github.com ---------------------------


Different from Repository "TestGitHub" which was created in github.com and then clone to local machine.
This time we initialize a repository in the local machine first and then push to the github.com

Step 1: Create a "TestGitHub_initFromLocal" first

Step 2: run [git bash]

Step 3: in git bach, switch to "TestGitHub_initFromLocal" folder

Step 4: [git init]

Step 5: [git status] 

we can use [git log] to see commits
	
Step 6: [git add .] to stage more than a single file	

for instance, this file is originally called "Test02.txt" and then renamed to "Test02.csv".

[git rm Test02.txt] removed the already staged "Test02.txt"

[git add .] stages [Test02.csv] and [Test03.csv]


------------------- end of this first exercise -------------------------
